# Rover-Rescue
Just Imagine you are a aeronautic space engineer and you launched a satellite with a rover in the search of water over mars. When your rover was just exploring the surface of mars your rover suddenly falls into a crater or while landing gets upside down it won’t get any sunlight or it might get stuck in a storm.
If that was the case we won’t be able to do anything remotely and mission would fail because in a steep crater rover can’t climb up hence resulting in failure of mission.
There  must be a way to solve this problem.
I aim to make a working prototype model of a rover which can fly in the thinest atmospheres in this repo,there will be three mechanisms in the prototype
THE DRONE SYSTEM
THE LAND SYSTEM
REMOTE CONTROL SYSTEM(the system which controls both of these mechanism remotely)

I am using esp32 as the main microcontroller of evrerything and L298N Motor Driver Module as module for the land system
obviously i am using ELECTRONIC SPEED CONTROLLERS for the drone system along with Brushless Motors
I MIGHT INTEGRATE MPU6050 GYROSCOPIC SENSOR AS I PROGRESS


Thats all
