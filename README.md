# Rover-Rescue
A Terrestrial rover mission could fail if the rover falls into a crater, lands upside down, or gets stuck in a dust storm, preventing it from receiving sunlight or moving. These situations would make remote recovery impossible, so there must be a solution to prevent such mission failures. I aim to make such rover which can fly in thin atmosphere
